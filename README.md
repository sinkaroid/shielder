## Notable
Since this tool embraces some ideas from another person, and I'm not an asshole, I'll many thanks:

-   [@justalinko/kagari](https://github.com/justalinko) as "milestone" and for making this tools "true"

## EOF

- feel free to make PR, maybe this tools just using `sucks` pattern and `weird` implementation, if u have more good ideas than this one, just PR.
- I am not responsible whether this is used for illegality or any cases that shells were stabbed from user to another user.
